## Installation

Step-by-step instructions to install the plugin:
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/RitzAtemo/RedMC/releases/) page
2. Place the `.jar` files into your server's `plugins` folder
3. Restart the server

## Configuration

All plugin settings are configured in their respective `config.yml` files. Messages can be customized in the corresponding `lang` folders, named according to the language (e.g., `en_US.yml`), which are automatically used based on the client’s language.

## Build
This project uses **Gradle** as its build system. To build all plugins, run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

This will compile the source code, run the necessary tasks, and produce `.jar` files in the `build/libs/` directory.

> If you are using Windows, use `gradlew.bat build` instead of `./gradlew build`.

## Test
To debug the plugins with Folia, use:

```bash
./gradlew runFolia
```

This will start a local Folia server instance with your plugins loaded, allowing you to test features in a real server environment.

> Tip: You can modify the run configuration in `build.gradle` if you want to change server version or plugin paths.
